            When someone mentions the word "education", my mind goes straight into my high school daysâ€”how I spent my hours studying, working on my assignments, socializing, having fun... those were the days I cherish the most for they have shaped me into who I am today. However, I discovered that I was appreciative of my youth because I had a supportive environment and those I could trust by my side. Education isn't merely about knowing mathematical equations and how to count taxes, it isn't just about writing a flawless essay and avoiding as many grammatical errors as possible: it is the joy of finding yourself, finding a purpose and finding those you wish to share those memories with. I want the journey to be accessible to all, even for those who thought they weren't born with the privilege. Sharing that little bit of joy, I hope the world can become a better place and people can live with happier hearts. It might not seem easy, it might seem too far-fetched, but shouldn't we try taking the first step to see where the road could possibly lead to? Rebuilding Project could be the start of the change we all wish to see.
